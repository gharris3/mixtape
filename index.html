    <p>Lyrics:Just like music..
Uh-huh, aiyyo yo, uh-huh yeah yeah, uh uh uh
There's no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, uh
Worrdd up..
Ahhh babyyy..
Just like music..
To relax my mind, so I can be free
And ab-sorb sound that keep me 'round
Doin my thang, constantly with no worries
Peace to Keith Murray.. ("just like music")
To keep me flowin and keep me goin
and keep me growin, and keep me the E from knowin
What happens out there, is not my concern
You wanna die it's not my turn ("just like music")
To do somethin to me like jump in the Mercedes
On the highway, doin over eighty
Without music baby.. ("Oww! I'll go crazy.. just like music")
Make me call my homey on the phone
Like there's somethin new out, that got me in the zone
Just that feelin, got me
I wish music can adopt me ("just like music")
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music
Put me in the mood with my woman
Got me in the ear, sayin sweet nothings
Make love come out the mouth, no frontin
Like all of a sudden, ("just like music")
Takin away your worries and cares
Any problems, music'll be right there
Together match yo, we a perfect pair
Is that true Marvin? ("Yeahhhhh! Music")
Yo, to get you to bang this
Body soul-snatcher, universal language
It be the light, so open up
This is it, what the fuck? ("just like music")
One fly tune
That have black and white vibe in one room
No confrontation, parlay all night
It's just the sensation ("just like music")
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a, happy day
Music makes a, cloud flow by baby
Your music is my tears in-side my eyes (just like music)
Your music makes me want to sing
Girl music, is a joy to bring (just like music)
Music is my heart and soul, more precious than gold
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
Happiness for days, justice all the way
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
I love your music baby (I got my music)
(Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music)
Hey (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music..</P>

    <p>Lyrics:Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say, Baby, grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn' drop no apple core
But I don't have grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
Hmm-mmh</P>

    <p>Lyrics:Come here, baby
Mary I love you, do it girl
Mary Jane, Mary Jane
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thing
She makes me feel alright
She makes my heart sing
And when I'm feeling low
She comes as no surprise
Turns me on with her love
Takes me to paradise, do you love me Mary Jane?
Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane
Don't you play no games
Mary Jane, I love her just the same
Mary Jane I love her, Mary baby, just the same, Mary Jane
The woman plays no games, now, now, now, Mary Jane
I'm in love with Mary Jane, I'm not the only one
If Mary wanna play around, I let her have her fun
She's not the kind of girl that you can just tie down
She likes to spread her love and turn your head around
Do ya love me Mary Jane, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane
Don't you play no games

        <h2 id="Never_Abandon_Your_Family">Never Abandon Your Family</h2>
    <p>Artist: Kanye West</p>
    <p>Lyrics: Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionally
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has
You know why my spirit's calling
Darkness can't take light from me
Haven't you gone far enough?
Sacrificed the ones you love
Gave up on your sanity
Like some twisted fantasy
What would I say to everything?
Your actions cost everything
My, my, my family
My family, I'm losing my family
I'm losing my family
Losing my family
Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream
"Why won't you answer me? I'm in the room"
"Tell mom you're sorry, " she's screaming at me
"Daddy, how could you leave?
Daddy, how could you leave?"
"Come back tonight, daddy, please
Come back tonight, daddy, please"
"Daddy, how could you leave?
Daddy, how could you leave?"
She don't know what this means, "How'd you become so mean?"
I wish I never screamed, "Alcohol when you breathe"
These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting
"Daddy promise you'll stay, don't you love me? Love me"
Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has</p>
