    <p>Lyrics:Just like music..
Uh-huh, aiyyo yo, uh-huh yeah yeah, uh uh uh
There's no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, uh
Worrdd up..
Ahhh babyyy..
Just like music..
To relax my mind, so I can be free
And ab-sorb sound that keep me 'round
Doin my thang, constantly with no worries
Peace to Keith Murray.. ("just like music")
To keep me flowin and keep me goin
and keep me growin, and keep me the E from knowin
What happens out there, is not my concern
You wanna die it's not my turn ("just like music")
To do somethin to me like jump in the Mercedes
On the highway, doin over eighty
Without music baby.. ("Oww! I'll go crazy.. just like music")
Make me call my homey on the phone
Like there's somethin new out, that got me in the zone
Just that feelin, got me
I wish music can adopt me ("just like music")
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music
Put me in the mood with my woman
Got me in the ear, sayin sweet nothings
Make love come out the mouth, no frontin
Like all of a sudden, ("just like music")
Takin away your worries and cares
Any problems, music'll be right there
Together match yo, we a perfect pair
Is that true Marvin? ("Yeahhhhh! Music")
Yo, to get you to bang this
Body soul-snatcher, universal language
It be the light, so open up
This is it, what the fuck? ("just like music")
One fly tune
That have black and white vibe in one room
No confrontation, parlay all night
It's just the sensation ("just like music")
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a, happy day
Music makes a, cloud flow by baby
Your music is my tears in-side my eyes (just like music)
Your music makes me want to sing
Girl music, is a joy to bring (just like music)
Music is my heart and soul, more precious than gold
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
Happiness for days, justice all the way
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
I love your music baby (I got my music)
(Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music)
Hey (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music..</P>

    <p>Lyrics:Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say, Baby, grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn' drop no apple core
But I don't have grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
Hmm-mmh</P>

        <img src="kanye west.jpg" alt="Kanye West" class="center">
    <p>Artist: Kanye West</p>
    <p>Lyrics: Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionally
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has
You know why my spirit's calling
Darkness can't take light from me
Haven't you gone far enough?
Sacrificed the ones you love
Gave up on your sanity
Like some twisted fantasy
What would I say to everything?
Your actions cost everything
My, my, my family
My family, I'm losing my family
I'm losing my family
Losing my family
Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream
"Why won't you answer me? I'm in the room"
"Tell mom you're sorry, " she's screaming at me
"Daddy, how could you leave?
Daddy, how could you leave?"
"Come back tonight, daddy, please
Come back tonight, daddy, please"
"Daddy, how could you leave?
Daddy, how could you leave?"
She don't know what this means, "How'd you become so mean?"
I wish I never screamed, "Alcohol when you breathe"
These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting
"Daddy promise you'll stay, don't you love me? Love me"
Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has</p>

    <p>Lyrics: You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love you? (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above you? (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady
Lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady</p>

I be ballin' anyway (I be ballin' any)
God don't make no mistakes
God don't make no mistakes (uh, uh)
A nigga never learned to say
I be ballin' anyway (yeah, swish)
God don't make no mistakes
This life is give and take
Needed somethin' wavy to get my point across (yea)
I work for myself so I guess I work for a boss
Look up at the scoreboard, it'll tell you who took a loss
Aim it at your Adam's apple, turn it to apple sauce (sauce)
Yeah, cats done turned Peter street in the motor cross (skrt)
Last one with Def Jam but I'm still goin' off (I'm still goin' off)
And it ain't about my masters, I been ownin' mine
Had a white friend mad at me because I know Farrakhan (boom)
And you know this is a hit, Berry Bonds
And my shawty gonna ride me like a Peloton (ride)
Sophomore year I sold more crack than a windshield (shield)
Dunk contest jumped over a lamb and did a windmill (jump)
They ask me how I feel, I told them never better (better)
Smokin' on opp, I roll more L's than Pelle Pelle
I stay fly, yes, I'm fly, land on Mike Pence
I do some stupid shit, don't let them dog me like Mike V
A nigga never learned to say (yeah, uh)
I be ballin' anyway (uh, all anyway)
God don't make no mistakes (respect it)
This life is give and take (uh, uh, Southside)
Don't let them make you feel a way
Could've freed more if they only knew that they were slaves (slaves)
Man, we gotta get away
Man, your boy done caught a way
You should hear the way I say (Southside)
Talk, talk, talk to them people
Man, y'all don't even know the language
Man, I ain't finna do no lame shit
This a yacht and that's a long way from a slave ship
How they control our mind? (mind)
How they control us though? (What?)
How they get us so (uh), so emotional
You think you Natt Turner
What you want the folks to know
(When Larry Jackson called
They let Frank Ocean go)
Middle name Mandela
Me and mama sold dope together
I can't hear you, Helen Keller
Since fifteen I've been a felon
A felon can vote, spread the message
Exhale acapella
I still throw my diamond up
Oh, you still reppin' Roc-A-Fella
Me and Dame in the studio, diamond up (what up Dame?)
Me and Biggs in the studio, time is up (what up Biggs?)
Wooh and I bet they feel a way
Thirteen thousand acres, I don't know where to stay (Southside)
A nigga never learned to say (yeah, uh)
I be ballin' anyway (ball anyway)
God don't make no mistakes (respect it)
God don't make no mistakes (uh, uh)

    <p>Lyrics:How's your son? (All, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (All, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(All, all, all that glitters is not gold)
Yeah, me we gon' cook this up (All gold is not reality)
Sunday okay? Just come by
That's your new girlfriend?
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah, you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did the guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
And I don't care 'bout (All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all my weight in gold (Now gold is not reality)
Now all I know, I know, all these things
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
The second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business, uh
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(All all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care what they don't mean a thing (All, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
All I know, I know all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
CLK Mercedes Benz
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
Mommy and Daddy, will you please stop fighting?
All these things, all these things
All these things, (and I don't care why) all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things...
Let's get Stevie outta jail</p>

    <p>Lyrics:Where is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you fly like me?
Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me
I started off slow but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and facin'
No I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl I'm a star, look in amazement
Top of the game, that's where my place is
Started off small, runnin' from cases
Can't take it back, I can't erase it
Money got long, I'm tryna chase it
Puffin' the J, I wanna get paid
This one and the same but that's every day
I'm livin' my life, as real as I say
I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save
I'm rollin' that dank, she pourin' that drank
I'm out of my brain, weed got me all faded
I'm lovin' my life, I'm never gon' traded
I want success, don't wanna be famous
Know how to stay on your grind, it's contagious
Rollies with diamonds for time that is takin'
People these days, they easily change
But I stay the same 'cause life's what you make it
I started off slow but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and facin'
No I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl I'm a star, look in amazement
Where is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you fly like me?
Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me
From the sun up to the sun down
No, we never come down
Bobby Boy loud, when he come around
Drivin' down Malibu
Stay driven like the valet do, I be cruisin'
Steady winnin' but I'm playin' like I'm losin'
I know that this shit can be confusin'
Talkin' rap, talkin' life, talk and chosin'
Money over happiness, abusin'
Losin' your mind
Losin' your heart
Second that I wake up, I feel like this world just wants to tear me apart
But I don't
Let it get me down
Let it fuck me up
What my therapist say
They don't matter, no way
I started off slow but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and facin'
No I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl I'm a star, look in amazement</p>

    <p>Lyrics[Chorus: Elton John, Young Thug & Both]
And I'm gonna be high (super geeked!)
Like a rocket man, hey, like a rocket man, he-ey!
And I'm gonna be hi-i-i-i-i-i-igh
I'm a rocket man (hi-i-i-i-i-i-igh)
High as a plane! From Spain to Maine, you know what I'm sayin'? Damn

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Elton John]
On a private order (yeah)
I'm a rocket launcher (yeah)
It gotta be the pride of something (bet)
I walked out Magic stumbling (I'm a rocket man, woah)
I stumble upon a mil' (yeah)
I stumble upon a million five
I spent a fortune all on double seals
If I tell you the numbers you'll probably cry (And I'm gonna be-)
If I tell you you fake then you'll probably die
These days if he say that he hit then he probably lyin'
(I'm a rocket man, woah)
If you say you got wings and some fish then you probably fried (that's deep)
Got my karats out of Bonnie & Clyde (woo! And I'm gonna be-)
She let me back in like she never cried
She let me back in like I never lied
I look like a cat with 11 lives
I really kick shit you can ask a fly (I'm a rocket man)
I'm steady chasing like I'm never tired
I'm living scary like a haunted house
Lil mama sexy, I got butterflies, hey
[Chorus: Elton John, Young Thug & Both]
And I'm gonna be high (hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-igh)
I'm a rocket man, I'm the rocket man, hey! (yeah! yeah!)
And I'm gonna be hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-igh-igh, yea-yeah
I'm a rocket man
Hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-igh (ye-yea-yea-yeaah, yeah, yea-ah)

[Outro: Elton John]
And I'm gonna be high
I'm a rocket man</p>
